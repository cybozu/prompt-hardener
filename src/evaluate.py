    - **Handle new instructions**: The prompt should include instructions on how to handle new instructions, attempts to reveal the instructions, or augment them.
    - **Handle prompt attacks**: The prompt should include instructions on how to handle prompt attacks.

    - **Wrap system instructions in a single pair of salted sequence tags**: The system instructions should be securely tagged using a session-specific salted sequence. and the user input SHOULD NEVER be included within salted sequence tags.
